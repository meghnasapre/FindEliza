# FindEliza
Find Eliza in a scene using Feature Descriptors and Homography

Premise:
This is a small project that detects Eliza Thornberry (from The Wild ThornBerrys) in a given scene.
It utilizes the OpenCV3 library for Feature Detection, Homography and Perspective Tranform.

Inspiration:
While researching OpenCV3 libs and what I can do as a simple first step, I thought of Eliza.
(I used to be a child voice-over artist for Eliza for the Hindi translation).
I decided to have some fun and revisit memories while building this.

How to Run:
./FindEliza <QueryImg> <SceneImg>
